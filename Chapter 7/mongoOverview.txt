 -- Overview of MongoDB

  # A NoSQL DB system, but with a document (in particular, JSON) orientation.

  # A 'server-based' DB: the 'mongod' ('d' for 'daemon' == background process) is the server

    ## You start MongoDB on a system by starting 'mongod'.

    ## There's a MongDB client ('shell') named 'mongo', which can be run from the command-line.

  # Supports various types of queries, including regular-expression searches.
    ## JavaScript can be used as the query language.

  # Implements 'data replication' to make data sets readily available to clients.

  # Also implements 'load balancing' through 'sharding' (that is, distributing) of data: data collections
    in a DB may be distributed 'horizontally' across various physical machines.

  # Supports 'map/reduce' in the sense of scatter/gather: scatter the pieces of a problem across
    Mongo processes, then gather the results together.

  # There's a free community edition.

  # Installation and setup are relatively straightforward.
