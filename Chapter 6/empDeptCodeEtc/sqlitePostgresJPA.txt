 -- The tie-in between moving to PostgreSQL and JPA relationships

  # Quick summary of the EmpDept app:

    -- Uses JPA annotations to model a @OneToMany relationship between Departments and Employees

    -- Populates the underlying tables with data for illustration and testing.

    -- Retrieves data from the underlying tables without any explicit queries in JPQL or SQL.

---------------------------------------------

  # The "JPA engine" must generate SQL to implement its high-level constructs,
    including relationships such as @OneToMany.

  # The target DB system, in our case SQLite or PostgreSQL, must implement the required SQL features.

  # In the Employee/Department JPA example, the JPA engine generates some ADD CONSTRAINT operations in SQL.

    ## SQLite doesn't support ADD CONSTRAINT, but PostgreSQL does.
