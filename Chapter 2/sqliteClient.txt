-- SQLite command-line client

 # Two basic ways to invoke:

   sqlite3             ## open a transient ('in-memory' only) DB, which can be backed up later

   sqlite3 recClub.db  ## open a specified DB, creating it if necessary

 # Commands:

   -- Any SQL command, terminated with a semicolon. Here's two examples:

      SELECT * FROM activities;

      SELECT name FROM customers WHERE cust_id IN 
       (SELECT customer_id FROM sessions WHERE activity_id IN
         (SELECT act_id FROM activities WHERE name = 'squash'));

   -- 'Meta-data' and utility commands, which begin with a period (.). Examples:

       .help                       ## help, .h for short
       
       .tables                     ## list all tables
       
       .schema                     ## list all schemas (structures) for all tables
       .schema activities          ## schema for activities table only
       .schema --indent activities ## pretty-print the schema
       
       .indices activities         ## user-created indices for the activities table
       
       .backup main test.db        ## save the in-memory DB 'main' (default) as file test.db

       .quit (or .exit)            ## quit the client (.q for short)

     ## There are also commands to save a DB as relevant SQL statements, and to create a
        DB from such statements.
