 -- The recClub database

 # The RecClub: customers pay to participate in activities, which are offered in sessions.

   Here's the format used below to describe the relations (tables): TableName(ColumnName1, ColumnName2,...)

   Customers(Name,                      ## for now, a single name 
             Id)                        ## Id is unique per customer ('primary key')

   Activities(Name,                     ## e.g., 'squash', 'bowling', '3-on-3 basketball'
              Cost,                     ## what the customer pays for the activity
              Id)                       ## unique per Activity ('primary key')

   Sessions(From,                       ## timestamp
            To,                         ## timestamp
            Activity_Id,                ## link to Activities ('foreign key')
            Customer_Id,                ## link to Customers  ('foreign key')
            Id)                         ## unique per Session ('primary key')


   Depiction of foreign keys:

    Sessions table
      ...           activity 10 (diving)
                        /
      Oct 1 | Oct 10 | 10 | 21 | 4
       /         \           \
     from        to       customer 21 (Bob21)
      ...

 # How to build the DB and its tables?

   -- Use the SQLite client ("command-line shell"): do it manually, import data (e.g., CSV), etc.

   -- Use a (Java) program: the thru-code approach

      ## We'll let the JDBC driver do the conversions from Java types to SQLite types
