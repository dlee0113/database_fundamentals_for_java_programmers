 -- Exercise in writing SELECT queries

 # Use the recClub.db, which can generated using the BuildTablesUtil.jar program, to write some arbitrary queries:
   look at the tables, figure out what kind of info might be interesting retrieve, and go for it.

   ## The SelectQueries.java can be used to get some ideas.

 # As part of the exercise, compare the advantages of the PreparedStatement over the Statement type. Here's an example
   from SelectQueries.java:

    SELECT name FROM customers WHERE cust_id IN 
     (SELECT customer_id FROM sessions WHERE activity_id IN
       (SELECT act_id FROM activities WHERE name = 'go'));     ## name = <some string>, <some string> must be in quotes

   ## In this case, the name of the activity ('go') is hard-wired into the query, as the point of the
      example is to show nested SELECT statements.

   ## But consider the WHERE construct more closely:

           WHERE <column attribute> = <value>

      If the <value> is a string (TEXT in SQLite), then it must be quoted (simple or double quotes):

           WHERE name = 'go'    ## ok
           WHERE name = "go"    ## ok
           WHERE name = go      ## not ok

   ## The issue for now is data-type conversion: between Java, on the one side, and SQLite, on the other side.
