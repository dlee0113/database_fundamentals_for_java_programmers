 -- Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) in SQL

 # The acronyms DDL and DML are common in discussions of relational databases:

   ## The DML is used to perform the familiar CRUD operations on database tables.

      ### We've seen (or will see) DML in action through a host of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands,
          including variations that include WHERE clauses, JOINs of different flavors, and 
          operators such as EXISTS and IN.

   ## Once a database with its tables is set up, programmers tend to focus on DML commands to
      generate reports by filtering, searching, sorting, updating, and otherwise processing database objects.

   ## The DDL is is used to create and modify the _structure_ of database objects such as tables,
      and to manage access rights through user roles.  

      ### Defining a table's schema--it's structure of typed fields--is a key part of DDL.

      ### The schema uses a type system to constrain what can be stored in a table.

          Example:

            The activities table in the recClub database has a schema that ensures:

               -- a unique (autoincremented) INTEGER value as a primary key

               -- a non-NULL name of no more than 24 characters: VARCHAR(24), an affinity type for TEXT

               -- a non-NULL cost of type DECIMAL

   ## We're seen DDL in action through the CREATE TABLE command, which in effect creates the table's schema.

   ## Some additional SQL examples not yet seen: 

sqlite> ALTER TABLE activities RENAME TO activity;  ## rename a table
sqlite> .tables
activity   customers  sessions 

sqlite> ALTER TABLE activity ADD COLUMN intensity_level VARCHAR(8);
sqlite> .schema activity
CREATE TABLE "activity" (act_id integer primary key autoincrement, name varchar(32) not null,
              cost decimal not null, intensity_level VARCHAR(8));

  ## SQLite has limited support the the ALTER TABLE command. For example, SQLite does not support
     the SQL-standard operations of renaming a column or dropping a column altogether.

 # Sometimes the DDL/DML distinction is refined further with additional acronyms such as 
   DCL (Data Control Language) and DQL (Data Query Language). In general, however, the DDL/DML 
   distinction remains the key one.
