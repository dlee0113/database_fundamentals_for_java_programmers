  -- The mercifully short story:

    # An academic by profession, but with lots of consulting experience as a programmer

      ## Full-time faculty member for 30-plus years in DePaul's College of Computing and Digital Media
         PhD from Northwestern University

      ## Long-term experience in programming production planning-scheduling systems (steel industry mostly) and
         product configuration systems (large-vehicle manufacturing mostly)

    # The hands-on approach is the hands-down best approach.

    # I've used Java since JDK 1.0 (whew!), and remain an enthusiast.
    
      ## Can't recall a real-world Java app of mine that didn't use a database.
